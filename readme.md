# 📖 Overview

This project is a backend REST API designed to manage users efficiently while demonstrating modern backend engineering practices.

The application was developed using _Node.js, **Express.js, and **MongoDB, then fully containerized with \*\*Docker_ and automated using _GitHub Actions CI/CD_ workflows.

The goal of this project wasn't only to build CRUD endpoints, but also to follow production-like development practices including containerization, automated builds, and clean project architecture.

# 🐳 Docker

The project is fully containerized.

### Build the image

bash
docker build -t users-management .

### Run the container

bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 users-management

Or simply use Docker Compose:

bash
docker compose up

---

# ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a .env file.

env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_connection_string

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/users-management.git

Enter the project

bash
cd users-management

Install dependencies

bash
npm install

Run locally

bash
npm start

---

# 🔄 CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:

- Checks out the repository
- Builds the Docker image
- Verifies the Docker build
- Ensures the project is ready for deployment

This demonstrates automated software delivery practices commonly used in professional development environments.
